Stylus-C
========

A 'Catalyst' verison of the Stylus content management software

Currently in pre-alpha development - updates coming every day. DO NOT USE - but keep an eye on as it 'comes' together.

The 'backend' admin function is largely done - various cosmetic updates are required ...

##Stuff that needs to be done.

Sort of issues with Safari / Chrome - page refresh not happening properly when retrieving a new article.
Create a 'Settings' function - article types / users etc.
Maybe a 'comments' function on the articles page.
Move data to a MySQL DB - from sqlite. Provide scripts to create / populate with initial values etc.
Front-end templating / ajax code
